# public_freeswitch_adapter

These files represent the Freeswitch Adapter that is compatible with the Immersitech Engage Core library. The use of this code is bound by the terms and conditions outlined in the attached Immersitech-Terms-of-Use.pdf file. 



## How to use

This code is for the current version of Freeswitch: 1.10.5. Clone the source code for Freeswitch 1.10.5 and then replace the mod_conference files and configure.ac with the files in repository. Then add the mod_imm_adapter folder to `./src/mod/applications`. Freeswitch should be built as normal, except now that it will include the Immersitech adapter.
